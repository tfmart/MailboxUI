[Inspired by this tweet from Jordan Singer](https://twitter.com/jsngr/status/1502401705429905420). Make sure you give his [@uiarchive](https://twitter.com/uiarchive) project a follow!

After seeing his tweet and [Figma Community file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1084228418951410787), I've deicded to try recreating the classic Mailbox app empty state entirely in SwiftUI. It was quite a fun and quick challenge to recreate the small details this seeming simple screen has.

You can interact with the filter controls on the top, as well as the compose and more button at the top of the screen, but don't exepect nothing to happen. Make sure you give me a follow on Twitter, you can find it by pressing the share button in the app
